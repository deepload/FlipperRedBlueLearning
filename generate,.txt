Generate Amazon KDP-compliant EPUB from enhanced guide

Perfect! Now I'll create a professional EPUB generator that converts your enhanced guide to Amazon KDP-compliant format. Let me create the conversion script:

enhanced_epub_generator.py
new
+728
Validate EPUB structure and compliance

Now I'll run the EPUB generator to create your Amazon KDP-compliant EPUB file:

…\Flipper > python enhanced_epub_generator.py


Let me check if the markdown library is available and install it if needed:

…\Flipper > pip install markdown


Let me create a simpler EPUB generator that uses only built-in Python libraries to avoid dependency issues:

simple_epub_generator.py
new
+565
…\Flipper > python simple_epub_generator.py

Let me check the status of the EPUB generation and create a simpler version if needed:
